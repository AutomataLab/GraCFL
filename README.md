## Project Overview
**GraCFL** is a vertex-centric graph system for solving CFL reachability analysis. The project includes multiple vertex-centric models for performing CFL reachability computations with different optimizations and parallel strategies.

## Dependencies
The project depends on the following libraries and tools:

- **CMake** (minimum version 3.26)
- **C++11 or higher** (supported by the project)
- **TBB** (Threading Building Blocks)
- **jemalloc** (for memory allocation)
- **OpenMP** (for parallelism)

The project automatically fetches and builds the necessary dependencies if they are not found on the system.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonym117/GraCFL.git
cd GraCFL
```

## Build Instructions

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a build directory:**

    First, create a directory for building the project and move into that directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2. **Configure the project using CMake:**

    Run the `cmake` command from the `build` directory to configure the project. By default, the project is set to use Release mode with `-O3` optimization:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
3. **Build the project:**

    Run the `make` command to build the project:
   
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    Executable named `gracfl` will be placed in build/bin/

## Running the CFL Reachability Analysis
After building, you can run the generated executables from the `build/bin/` directory as follows:

### First Create your ConfigGraCFL file

Place a plain-text file named  `ConfigGraCFL` (no extension) alongside the executable (i.e. in `build/bin/`) with one `key = value` per line:

```text
# Required inputs:
graphFilepath    = /home/user/data/graph.txt
grammarFilepath  = /home/user/data/grammar.txt

# Optional settings (defaults shown):
executionMode      = serial           # serial or parallel (default: serial)
traversalDirection = bi               # fw, bw, or bi (default: bi if serial or fw if parallel)
processingStrategy = gram-driven      # gram-driven or topo-driven (default: gram-driven)
numThreads         = 32               # positive integer, only used if parallel (default: all available cores)
```

### For stable parallel runs
Before invoking the executable in parallel mode, export these OpenMP settings to improve thread binding and reduce spin‐wait overhead:
```bash
export OMP_PROC_BIND=true
export OMP_WAIT_POLICY=ACTIVE
```

### Then Run the Following Command

```bash
./gracfl
```

Note: The `ConfigGraCFL` file and the executable `gracfl` need to be in the same directory.

## Example Graph and Grammar

To help you get started, here’s a minimal example of an input graph and a normalized (Chomsky Normal Form) grammar for CFL reachability.

### Sample Graph (`sample_graph.txt`)

Each line is a directed, labeled edge in the format: `src dst label`
```text
0 1 a
1 2 b
2 3 a
3 4 b
```

### Sample Normalized Grammar (sample_grammar.txt)
Each line represents a production rule in the grammar. A rule of type `A = BC` is written in this format `A    B    C`
```
A                   # epsilon rule creates self edges
A    a              # unary rule
B    b              # unary rule
S    A    B         # binary rule
```

## Benchmark Graphs and Grammar Files

The benchmark graphs and grammar files used in the research paper are sourced from the Graspan project and are available for download. These files are necessary to reproduce the experiments and results described in the paper. You can download them from the following Google Drive link:

## GraCFL as a Library
1. Clone into your project
    In your external project’s root directory:
    ```text
    https://github.com/AutomataLab/GraCFL.git
    ```
2. CMake configuration
    In your `CMakeLists.txt`, add GraCFL as a subdirectory and link against its static library:
    ```cmake
    # Add the GraCFL library as a subdirectory
    add_subdirectory(GraCFL)
    ```
    ```cmake
    # Link against the static library
    target_link_libraries(run_graCFL PRIVATE graCFLlib)
    ```

    An Example `CMakeLists.txt` of an external project that uses GraCFL as a library
    ```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
    project(ExternalGraCFLUser)
    
    # Add the GraCFL library as a subdirectory
    add_subdirectory(GraCFL)
  
    # Other configurations in your CMakeLists.txt
     
    # Build your executable
    add_executable(ExternalGraCFLUserExecutable main.cpp)
    
    # Link against the static library
    target_link_libraries(run_graCFL PRIVATE graCFLlib)
    ```
    
3. Sample usage in code

    ```cpp
    // include this header if you want to print the exception message
    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>
    #include <unordered_set>
    
    // As the function throws error, we need to include the stdexcept header
    #include <stdexcept>
    
    /*
    * include this two headers to use the GraCFL api
    */
    #include "solvers/Solver.hpp"
    #include "utils/Config.hpp"
    
    /*
    * @brief Example function demonstrating the usage of the GraCFL api.
    * 
    * This function initializes a configuration object, creates a Solver instance,
    * and executes the CFL-reachability analysis. It handles exceptions and prints
    * usage instructions in case of errors.
    * Note: The function name 'example' is just a placeholder and can be changed as needed.
    * The code snippet below can be added to a larger program or used as a standalone example.
    * It is assumed that the necessary headers and namespaces are included at the beginning of the file.
    */      
    void example() {
        try {
            // Create a configuration object
            gracfl::Config config;
            // Set the configuration parameters
    
            // graphFilepath and grammarFilepath are required parameters
            config.graphFilepath = "path/to/graph.edgelist";
            config.grammarFilepath = "path/to/grammar.cfg";
    
            // Optional parameters
            config.executionMode = "parallel"; // or "serial"
            config.traversalDirection = "fw"; // or "bw" or "bi"
            config.processingStrategy = "gram-driven"; // or "topo-driven"
            config.numThreads = 32; // Number of threads for parallel execution
    
            // Print the configuration settings
            config.printConfigs();
            // Create a Solver instance with the configuration
            gracfl::Solver* solver = new gracfl::Solver(config);
            // Execute the CFL-reachability analysis
            solver->solve();
            // Retrieve the CFL-reachability graph:
            // outputCFLGraph[node][label] is the set of all reachable destination node IDs from the source node with the edge label.
            std::vector<std::vector<std::unordered_set<ull>>> outputCFLGraph = solver->getGraph();
            // Clean up the solver instance
            delete solver;
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
            // Handle exceptions and print error messages
            std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << "\n\n";
            // Print usage instructions for the GraCFL API
            gracfl::Config::printUsage("example");
        }
    }
    ```
